- Elasticsearch is really needed?
No, I can implement a search (via the query string) against the database.
```
In [3]: Bottle.objects.filter(name__icontains='bARolo')
Out[3]: <QuerySet [<Bottle: 2|Barolo DOCG|Tenimenti Ca' Bianca|2013>]>
```
Check out DJRF, which lets the search to happen in sevarl fields (even related model's fields):
